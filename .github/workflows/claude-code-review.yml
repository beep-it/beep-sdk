            Review this PR thoroughly. Focus on:
            - Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth issues)
            - Logic errors and edge cases
            - Code quality and maintainability
            - Missing error handling
            - Performance concerns
            - Breaking changes or backwards compatibility issues

            Be thorough and provide specific, actionable feedback. Do not approve without substantive review.
